    "## Topic\n",
    "*What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*\n",
    "The problem I aim to address is the unemployment among veterans and how it relates to federal spending on veterans programs. This topic is crucial as large numbers of veterans struggle to find gainful eomployment after military seperation, which can lead to other issues involving impacts to mental, physical and emotional health. High unemployment rates among veterans lead financial hardship, mental health issues, and a loss of valuable skills in the workforce. Analyzing the effectiveness of current government programs in reducing veteran unemployment is essential to optimize resource allocation, improving support services, and effectively using taxpayer dollars."

    "1. What are the trends in veteran unemployment rates from 2014 up til now (excluding COVID years)?\n",
    "2. How has the Department of Veterans Affairs' spending changed over the same period, particularly in programs aimed at employment support?\n",
    "3. Is there a correlation between VA spending on employment programs and the unemployment rates among veterans?\n",
    "5. Are any changes in veterans employment rates explauined by nationwide changes?"

    "## What would an answer look like?\n",
    "*What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*\n",
    "I want to examine the impacts of US spending on veterans employment programs and how it relates to veteran unemployment rates. By using government spending as the independent variable and veteran unemployment rates as the dependent variable, the regression analysis will help determine if increased spending correlates with a reduction in unemployment among veterans or if there is no significant relationship between the two variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once I have identified any possible trends in the data between the two, I will examine that against the unemployment percent of change for the entire US, to see if any trends identified by the spending analysis can be explained by a nationwide shift not related to veterans program spending.Using a correlation coefficient I can see if veterans unemployment decreased by 2% annually while national unemployment dropped by 1.5% during the same period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another visual would show veterans unemployment rates before and after significant increases in government spending on veterans employment programs. The chart could show veterans unemployment rates for two periods: before the spending increase and after the increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the conclusion of this analysis I intend to show that there is a distinct relationship between government spending and veterans unemployment rates. I feel that the results will show that increses in spending result in decreases in eunemployment rates. "
